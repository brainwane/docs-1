1.  Mailchimp contacts are like Buttondown subscribers. Export your Mailchimp contacts [here](https://mailchimp.com/help/view-export-contacts/ "here").
2.  Go to https://buttondown.email/subscribers. You may need to log in first.
3.  Click the _Import_ button at the top of the page, then choose the `.csv` file you just downloaded from Mailchimp.

## FAQs

### Do subscribers need to re-enter their credit card?

Mailchimp and Buttondown use the same payments processor â€” [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ "Stripe").

Stripe has your subscribers' information:

- credit cards
- purchases
- subscriptions

You bring your subscribers' history to Buttondown when you connect your Stripe account to Buttondown. You will have their payment histories, too.

**Your paying subscribers do not need to do anything extra when you switch to Buttondown**. Just email me when you've connected your Stripe account. I'll take care of the rest, for free!

P.S. Over time, I'd like to make this process a little more automatic but at the moment it requires a bit of manual labor on my part to make sure everything is wired up correctly (free of charge, of course.)
